    r"""Randomly zero out entire channels (a channel is a 2D feature map,
    e.g., the :math:`j`-th channel of the :math:`i`-th sample in the
    batched input is a 2D tensor :math:`\text{input}[i, j]`) of the input tensor).
    Each channel will be zeroed out independently on every forward call.
    with probability :attr:`p` using samples from a Bernoulli distribution.

    Usually the input comes from :class:`nn.Conv2d` modules.

    As described in the paper
    `Efficient Object Localization Using Convolutional Networks`_ ,
    if adjacent pixels within feature maps are strongly correlated
    (as is normally the case in early convolution layers) then i.i.d. dropout
    will not regularize the activations and will otherwise just result
    in an effective learning rate decrease.

    In this case, :func:`nn.Dropout2d` will help promote independence between
    feature maps and should be used instead.

    Args:
        p (float, optional): probability of an element to be zero-ed.
        inplace (bool, optional): If set to ``True``, will do this operation
            in-place

    Shape:
        - Input: :math:`(N, C, H, W)`
        - Output: :math:`(N, C, H, W)` (same shape as input)

    Examples::

        >>> m = VarDropout4Bert(p=0.2)
        >>> input = torch.randn(20, 16, 32, 32)
        >>> output = m(input)
