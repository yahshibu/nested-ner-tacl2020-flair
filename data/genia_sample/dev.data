When cells were treated with IL-4 for 5 hours before LPS activation , both the c-fos and the c-jun mRNA expression was decreased .
5,6 G#protein

The inhibition of c-fos and c-jun expression by IL-4 in LPS-treated cells was shown to be due to a lower transcription rate of the c-fos and c-jun genes .
3,4 G#DNA|8,9 G#protein|10,12 G#cell_type|24,25 G#DNA|26,28 G#DNA|24,28 G#DNA

IL-4 did not affect the stability of the c-fos and c-jun transcripts .
0,1 G#protein|8,9 G#protein|10,12 G#protein

Finally , using electrophoretic mobility shift assays , evidence was obtained that IL-4 inhibits LPS-induced expression of AP-1 protein .
12,13 G#protein|17,18 G#protein

These data indicate that IL-4 suppresses the induction of transcription factors in human activated monocytes .

Transient pseudohypoaldosteronism in obstructive renal disease with transient reduction of lymphocytic aldosterone receptors .
10,13 G#protein

Results in two affected infants .


We report two patients with transient pseudohypoaldosteronism due to obstructive renal disease .


Both patients presented with a salt-losing episode simulating adrenal insufficiency .


In one patient , transient reduction of aldosterone receptors could be documented , while in the second patient the clinical and biochemical parameters were consistent with transient pseudohypoaldosteronism .

Aldosterone receptors were normal in both patients

Aldosterone-specific membrane receptors and rapid non-genomic actions of mineralocorticoids .
0,3 G#protein

Functional studies in extrarenal , non-epithelial cells such as smooth muscle cells and more recently circulating human lymphocytes have provided increasing evidence that aldosterone produces not only classical genomic effects , but also rapid , non-genomic effects on transmembrane electrolyte movements .
3,7 G#cell_type|9,12 G#cell_type|16,18 G#cell_type|15,18 G#cell_type

These involve activation of the sodium/proton exchanger of the cell membrane at very low , physiological concentrations of aldosterone with an acute onset within 1-2 min .
5,7 G#protein

A second messenger cascade involved is the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate /calcium pathway which responds over the same rapid time course .


Such changes clearly can not be explained by genomic mechanisms , which are responsible for later effects than the membrane related rapid responses .


The mechanisms underlying these rapid effects of aldosterone on electrolytes have been extensively studied in human lymphocytes , which thus may represent valuable tools in the delineation of the receptor-effector mechanisms involved .
15,17 G#cell_type

The unique characteristics of this new pathway for steroid action include its rapid time course , 10,000-fold selectivity for aldosterone over cortisol and the ineffectiveness of spironolactones , classical mineralocorticoid antagonists , as antagonists of the response .


Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Nef protein inhibits NF-kappa B induction in human T cells .
0,7 G#protein|8,10 G#protein|12,15 G#cell_type

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) can establish a persistent and latent infection in CD4+ T lymphocytes ( W.C.Greene , N.Engl.J. Med.324 : 308-317 , 1991 ; S.M.Schnittman , M.C.Psallidopoulos , H.C. Lane , L.Thompson , M.Baseler , F.Massari , C.H.Fox , N.P.Salzman , and A.S.Fauci , Science 245 : 305-308 , 1989 ) .
16,19 G#cell_type

Production of HIV-1 from latently infected cells requires host cell activation by T-cell mitogens ( T.Folks , D.M.Powell , M.M.Lightfoote , S.Benn , M.A. Martin , and A.S.Fauci , Science 231 : 600-602 , 1986 ; D.Zagury , J. Bernard , R.Leonard , R.Cheynier , M.Feldman , P.S.Sarin , and R.C. Gallo , Science 231 : 850-853 , 1986 ) .
12,14 G#protein

This activation is mediated by the host transcription factor NF-kappa B [ G.Nabel and D.Baltimore , Nature ( London ) 326 : 711-717 , 1987 ] .
6,9 G#protein|9,11 G#protein

We report here that the HIV-1 -encoded Nef protein inhibits the induction of NF-kappa B DNA-binding activity by T-Â cell mitogens .
5,9 G#protein|13,15 G#protein|18,20 G#protein

However , Nef does not affect the DNA-binding activity of other transcription factors implicated in HIV-1 regulation , including SP-1 , USF , URS , and NF-AT .
2,3 G#protein|11,13 G#protein|19,20 G#protein|21,22 G#protein|23,24 G#protein|26,27 G#protein

Additionally , Nef inhibits the induction of HIV-1- and interleukin 2- directed gene expression , and the effect on HIV-1 transcription depends on an intact NF-kappa B -binding site .
2,3 G#protein|25,27 G#protein|25,29 G#DNA

These results indicate that defective recruitment of NF-kappa B may underlie Nef 's negative transcriptional effects on the HIV-1 and interleukin 2 promoters .
7,9 G#protein|11,12 G#protein|18,23 G#DNA

Further evidence suggests that Nef inhibits NF-kappa B induction by interfering with a signal derived from the T-cell receptor complex .

Expression of c-fos , c-jun and jun B in peripheral blood lymphocytes from young and elderly adults .
2,3 G#DNA|4,5 G#DNA|6,8 G#DNA

The expression of c-fos , c-jun and jun B proto-oncogenes was studied in phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) activated peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBL ) from young and aged humans .
3,10 G#DNA|13,14 G#protein|15,16 G#protein|13,21 G#cell_line|22,23 G#cell_type

Specific mRNAs for c-fos and c-jun were detectable within 30 min after cell activation and reached maximal levels within 2 h .
1,2 G#RNA|3,4 G#DNA|5,6 G#DNA

Both c-fos and jun B mRNAs decreased to pre-activation levels within 6 h , while c-jun mRNA remained elevated .
1,2 G#RNA|3,6 G#RNA|1,6 G#RNA|15,17 G#RNA

In PHA -activated PBL , no age-related differences were observed in c-fos or jun B mRNA expression .
1,2 G#protein|1,4 G#cell_line

However , c-jun mRNA levels decreased significantly ( 1.73 +/- 0.08 vs. 1.16 +/- 0.09 arbitrary units , P &lt; 0.01 , young vs. old ) in PBL from elderly individuals activated with PHA .
2,4 G#RNA|27,28 G#cell_type|33,34 G#protein

Because previous work has demonstrated that T cells from elderly individuals may display normal proliferative responses when activated via the anti-CD2 pathway , c-jun and jun B mRNA expression was also studied in anti-CD2-activated purified T cells .
6,8 G#cell_type|20,21 G#protein|35,37 G#cell_type|33,37 G#cell_line

No age-related differences were found in the expression of either of these two proto-oncogenes by anti-CD2 activated T cells .
13,14 G#DNA

These results suggest that the decreased IL-2 production and proliferative response displayed by PHA -activated PBL from elderly adults may be related to age-related changes in c-jun mRNA expression and in the ratio of c-fos to c-jun mRNA .

Oct2 transactivation from a remote enhancer position requires a B-cell-restricted activity .
0,1 G#protein|4,7 G#DNA

Previous cotransfection experiments had demonstrated that ectopic expression of the lymphocyte-specific transcription factor Oct2 could efficiently activate a promoter containing an octamer motif .
10,13 G#protein|13,14 G#protein|18,19 G#DNA|21,23 G#DNA

Oct2 expression was unable to stimulate a multimerized octamer enhancer element in HeLa cells , however .
0,1 G#protein|7,11 G#DNA|12,14 G#cell_line

We have tested a variety of Oct2 isoforms generated by alternative splicing for the capability to activate an octamer enhancer in nonlymphoid cells and a B-cell line .
6,8 G#protein|18,20 G#DNA|21,23 G#cell_type|25,27 G#cell_line

Our analyses show that several Oct2 isoforms can stimulate from a remote position but that this stimulation is restricted to B cells .
5,7 G#protein|20,22 G#cell_type

This result indicates the involvement of either a B-cell-specific cofactor or a specific modification of a cofactor or the Oct2 protein in Oct2 -mediated enhancer activation .
8,10 G#protein|16,17 G#protein|19,21 G#protein|22,23 G#protein

Mutational analyses indicate that the carboxy-terminal domain of Oct2 is critical for enhancer activation .
5,7 G#protein|8,9 G#protein

Moreover , this domain conferred enhancing activity when fused to the Oct1 protein , which by itself was unable to stimulate from a remote position .
11,13 G#protein

The glutamine-rich activation domain present in the amino-terminal portion of Oct2 and the POU domain contribute only marginally to the transactivation function from a distal position .
1,4 G#protein|10,11 G#protein|7,11 G#protein|13,15 G#protein

The promoter of the CD19 gene is a target for the B-cell-specific transcription factor BSAP .
1,2 G#DNA|4,6 G#DNA|11,14 G#protein|14,15 G#protein

The CD19 protein is expressed on the surface of all B-lymphoid cells with the exception of terminally differentiated plasma cells and has been implicated as a signal-transducing receptor in the control of proliferation and differentiation .
1,3 G#protein|10,12 G#cell_type|16,20 G#cell_type

Here we demonstrate complete correlation between the expression pattern of the CD19 gene and the B-cell-specific transcription factor BSAP in a large panel of B-lymphoid cell lines .
11,13 G#DNA|15,18 G#protein|18,19 G#protein|24,27 G#cell_line

The human CD19 gene has been cloned , and several BSAP -binding sites have been mapped by in vitro protein-DNA binding studies .
2,4 G#DNA|1,4 G#DNA|10,11 G#protein|10,13 G#DNA

In particular , a high-affinity BSAP-binding site instead of a TATA sequence is located in the -30 promoter region upstream of a cluster of heterogeneous transcription start sites .
4,7 G#DNA|10,12 G#DNA|16,19 G#DNA|24,28 G#DNA

Moreover , this site is occupied by BSAP in vivo in a CD19-expressing B-cell line but not in plasma or HeLa cells .
7,8 G#protein|13,15 G#cell_line|12,15 G#cell_line|18,19 G#cell_type|20,22 G#cell_line

This high-affinity site has been conserved in the promoters of both human and mouse CD19 genes and was furthermore shown to confer B-cell specificity to a beta-globin reporter gene in transient transfection experiments .
1,3 G#DNA|8,9 G#DNA|11,16 G#DNA

In addition , BSAP was found to be the only abundant DNA-binding activity of B-cell nuclear extracts that interacts with the CD19 promoter .
3,4 G#protein|21,23 G#DNA

Together , this evidence strongly implicates BSAP in the regulation of the CD19 gene .

Eicosanoids in breast cancer patients before and after mastectomy .


In 19 patients with a malignant breast tumor , tumor tissue and blood were taken to determine the eicosanoid profile and platelet aggregation .
21,22 G#cell_type

Values were compared with those of patients with benign tumors ( n = 4 ) , or undergoing a mammary reduction ( n = 7 ) .


Postoperatively , blood was taken as well in order to compare pre- and postoperative values .


Eicosanoids were measured in peripheral blood monocytes and mammary tissue by means of HPLC ; furthermore , TXA2 , 6-keto-PGF1 alpha , and PGE2 were determined by RIA .
4,7 G#cell_type

Differences in pre- and postoperative values of cancer patients were seen in plasma RIA values : PGE2 and 6-k-PGF1 alpha were significantly higher preoperatively when compared with postoperatively , however , such differences were seen in the control groups as well .


Compared to benign tumor or mammary reduction test material the eicosanoid profile of tissue obtained from malignant mammary tumors showed important differences .


Except for PGF2 alpha , HHT and 15-HETE no detectable quantities of eicosanoids were found in the non-tumor material , whereas in the malignant tumor material substantial quantities of a number of eicosanoid metabolites were present .


Statistically significant correlations could be established between patient/histopathology data and the results of the platelet aggregation assays , e.g. between menopausal status and ADP aggregation ; oestrogen receptor ( +/- ) and collagen and arachidonic acid aggregation , inflammatory cell infiltration score and arachidonic acid aggregation and fibrosis score and ADP aggregation .
14,15 G#cell_type|26,28 G#protein|32,33 G#protein

The results show that eicosanoid synthesis in material from mammary cancer patients is different from that in benign mammary tissue .


The implications , in particular , in relation to future prognosis of the patient , remain obscure .


Mineralocorticoids and mineralocorticoid receptors in mononuclear leukocytes in patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension .
2,4 G#protein|5,7 G#cell_type

To examine the role of mineralocorticoids in the pathophysiology of pregnancy-induced hypertension ( PIH ) , we studied plasma aldosterone and 18-hydroxycorticosterone levels in 25 women with PIH and 25 normal pregnant women , as controls .


Furthermore , we evaluated the mineralocorticoid receptor ( MR ) status in mononuclear leukocytes in the 2 groups .
5,7 G#protein|8,9 G#protein|12,14 G#cell_type

MR count was significantly ( P less than 0.0005 ) decreased in the PIH group ( 148 +/- 9 binding sites/cell ) compared with the control group ( 300 +/- 17 binding sites/cell ; mean +/- SEM ) .
0,1 G#protein

Plasma aldosterone in women with PIH was 281 +/- 61 pmol/L ; in normal pregnant women it was 697 +/- 172 pmol/L ( P less than 0.025 ) .


Plasma 18-hydroxycorticosterone was also significantly ( P less than 0.025 ) lower ( PIH , 1071 +/- 149 pmol/L ; controls , 1907 +/- 318 pmol/L ) .


These values were determined at the onset of clinical symptoms of PIH .


These results can not be explained by receptor down-regulation due to higher levels of mineralocorticoids in PIH ; a hitherto unknown mineralocorticoid may , thus , be responsible for the hypertension and altered MR status .

Structure function analysis of vitamin D analogs with C-ring modifications .


Analogs of 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ( 1 alpha,25-(OH) 2D3 ) with substitutions on C-11 were synthesized .


Small apolar substitutions ( 11 alpha-methyl , 11 alpha-fluoromethyl ) did not markedly decrease the affinity for the vitamin D receptor , but larger ( 11 alpha-chloromethyl or 11 alpha- or 11 beta-phenyl ) or more polar substitutions ( 11 alpha-hydroxymethyl , 11 alpha-(2-hydroxyethyl ] decreased the affinity to less than 5 % of that of 1 alpha,25-OH)2D3 .
18,21 G#protein

Their affinity for the vitamin D -binding protein , however , increased up to 4-fold .
4,8 G#protein

The biological activity of 11 alpha-methyl-1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 closely resembled that of the natural hormone on normal and leukemic cell proliferation and bone resorption , whereas its in vivo effect on calcium metabolism of the rachitic chick was about 50 % of that of 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 .
17,19 G#cell_type

The 11 beta-methyl analog had a greater than 10-fold lower activity .


The differentiating effects of the other C-11 analogs on human promyeloid leukemia cells ( HL-60 ) agreed well with their bone-resorbing activity and receptor affinity , but they demonstrated lower calcemic effects in vivo .
9,13 G#cell_line|14,15 G#cell_line

Large or polar substitutions on C-11 of 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 thus impair the binding of the vitamin D receptor but increase the affinity to vitamin D-binding protein .
15,18 G#protein|23,26 G#protein

The effects of many C-11-substituted 1 alpha,25-(OH)2D3 analogs on HL-60 cell differentiation exceeded their activity on calcium metabolism .

In order to further understand the apparent glucocorticoid resistance in major depressive disorder , circadian variation in cortisol concentration , dexamethasone suppression and glucocorticoid receptor binding in mononuclear leukocytes , polymorphonuclear leukocytes and cultured skin fibroblasts were measured in rigidly defined major depressive disorder patients and non-depressed psychiatric controls .
27,29 G#cell_type|30,32 G#cell_type|33,36 G#cell_line

Mononuclear leukocytes binding to glucocorticoid correlated significantly with polymorphonuclear leukocytes binding to glucocorticoid , but both determinations failed to differentiate major depressive disorder and control subjects .

Initial and post- dexamethasone in vitro fibroblast binding to glucocorticoid was not different between major depressive disorder and non-depressed control subjects .

The phenomenon of glucocorticoid resistance in major depressive disorder remains unexplained .

In vitro effects of aldosterone on the intracellular concentrations of sodium , potassium and calcium , cell volume and the sodium -proton-antiport have been described in intact human mononuclear leukocytes ( HML ) .
